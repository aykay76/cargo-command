# Cargo Command
Cargo Command allows you to take control of your own shipping line! Navigate the trials and tribulations of global politics, consumer demand and natural events and see if you can succeed as a shipping magnate.

## Game Sequence
Once started the game will continue to run as a discrete event simulation. Each step in the simulation will represent a period of time in real life. For example, the simulation will step forward one hour of world time every minute in the simulation. So the simulation is continuous but not real-time.

Built-in random events and player triggered events will change the course of the game.

The aim of the game is to have the most money when the game finishes. Each game could be a fixed term, or continues until there is only one player left who is declared the winner. When the term is finished the player with the most money wins.

## Players

Every player starts the game with $1bn. With that they can buy their first small vessel or maybe charter a few vessels to cater to more demand, but at a higher cost.

As the game proceeds players will be notified of what is happening and what opportunities are available to make money. They will act on those things by moving vessels, buying vessels, offering vessels to sell, changing routes, negotiating with other players etc.

## Vessels
Vessels are categorised as small, medium and large.

Size    Capacity    Price   Charter
Small   4,000 TEU   $100m   $10k/day
Medium  12,000 TEU  $250m   $25k/day
Large   20,000 TEU  $500m   $50k/day

Players can buy vessels and charter vessels. When a player owns a vessel they can choose to use it for shipping or charter it to another player. As the game proceeds, players who once chartered may decide to buy their own vessel so just buying vessels and chartering them to others could be a risky strategy!
The typical ROIC for a vessel is 3 years, but this could be extended if the vessel isn't actively chartered, or if damaged or being re-fitted.

## Ports
Vessels will take products from port to port facilitating global trade and commerce.

## Events
Various events can affect the course of the game:

- conflict, delays shipping but increases prices
- fuel changes, vessels need to be re-fit
- accidents, damage and dry dock time will affect performance
- cargo damage could reduce reputation and increase insurance cost
- new trade routes, reduce shipping time and increase performance
- pirates can seize vessel taking produce and causing damage/delays
- port strike, could delay ships and increase costs
- sudden demand, events like Christmas could cause spikes in demand
- fuel price surge would affect price and customer satisfaction
- storms, earthquakes, volcanoes could affect ports and vessels
